# Requests and Offers - hREA Mapping Document

This document provides a detailed mapping of the core features and functionalities of the Requests & Offers - HC/MVP Holochain application to the corresponding hREA concepts. This mapping is crucial for understanding how the economic flow of the network is managed and tracked within the application.

## User Profiles

- **hREA Concept**: Person agents
- **Mapping**: Each user profile in the application corresponds to a Person agent in hREA. This includes both Creators/Projects/Developers and Holochain Advocates. The custom zome for profile retrieval and agent relationships can be mapped to the hREA's agent management capabilities, allowing for the tracking and management of agent relationships within the network.

## Skills

- **hREA Concept**: Resources
- **Mapping**: Skills are considered as resources in hREA. This mapping allows for the tracking of skills as resources that can be offered, requested, or matched within the network. The custom zome for managing skills can be integrated with hREA's resource management capabilities to ensure that skills are accurately tracked and managed.

## Categories

- **hREA Concept**: Resource Specification
- **Mapping**: Categories can be mapped to Resource Specifications in hREA. This allows for the classification of resources (including skills) into specific categories, facilitating the organization and management of resources within the network. The custom zome for managing categories can be integrated with hREA's resource specification capabilities to ensure that categories are accurately tracked and managed.

## Projects

- **hREA Concept**: Resource Specification
- **Mapping**: Projects can be considered as Resource Specifications in hREA, especially if they involve the creation of one or multiple deliverable resources. This mapping allows for the tracking of projects as resources that can be requested, offered, or matched within the network. The custom zome for managing projects can be integrated with hREA's resource specification capabilities to ensure that projects are accurately tracked and managed.

## Organizations

- **hREA Concept**: Organization agents
- **Mapping**: Organizations are considered as agents in hREA. This mapping allows for the tracking of organizations as agents within the network, facilitating the management of agent relationships and the allocation of resources. The custom zome for managing organizations can be integrated with hREA's agent management capabilities to ensure that organizations are accurately tracked and managed.

## Requests and Offers

- **hREA Concept**: Proposals
- **Mapping**: Requests and offers are considered as Proposals in hREA. This mapping allows for the tracking of requests and offers as proposals within the network, facilitating the management of economic activities and the matching of needs with offers. The custom zome for managing requests and offers can be integrated with hREA's proposal management capabilities to ensure that requests and offers are accurately tracked and managed.

## Administrator and Moderation Functionalities

- **hREA Concept**: Governance
- **Mapping**: Administrator and moderation functionalities can be mapped to the governance capabilities of hREA. This allows for the management of the network's economic activities and the enforcement of rules and policies within the network. The custom zome for managing administrator and moderation functionalities can be integrated with hREA's governance capabilities to ensure that these functions are accurately tracked and managed.

## Search Functionality

- **hREA Concept**: Querying
- **Mapping**: The search functionality can be mapped to the querying capabilities of hREA. This allows for the efficient searching of resources, agents, projects, and proposals within the network. The custom zome for managing search functionality can be integrated with hREA's querying capabilities to ensure that search results are accurately tracked and managed.

By mapping each of the application's core features and functionalities to the corresponding hREA concepts, you can ensure that the economic flow of the network is accurately tracked and managed within the application. This mapping will facilitate the development of a robust and efficient Holochain application that effectively facilitates the exchange of requests and offers within the hAppenings.community.
